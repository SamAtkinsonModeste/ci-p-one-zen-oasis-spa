### Fonts

- Adobe's [Amandine](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/amandine) font has clean lines and graceful curves that evoke a sense of elegance and tranquillity.
  It complements the serene atmosphere of Zen Oasis, conveying relaxation and sophistication.
  Amandine’s legibility ensures that headings are easy to read, even at larger sizes. The balanced letterforms enhance clarity, making it ideal for titles and headers. Amandine works well across various devices and screen resolutions. Whether on a desktop or mobile, it maintains its visual appeal.

- Adobe's [Aptly](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/aptly) font was used for body text. It is also a sans-serif font, and the combination of **Amandine** (for headings) and **Aptly** (for body text) creates a pleasing contrast. **Amandine’s** sophistication draws attention, while **Aptly** maintains legibility, striking a harmonious balance.
  **Aptly’s** contemporary aesthetics align with the site's modern and serene vibe. Its simplicity conveys professionalism and a sense of calm. Aptly adapts well to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience on desktops, tablets, and mobiles.
